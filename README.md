This repository contains my solutions to tasks from the Programming Fundamentals with Python course at SoftUni. 
The course is part of the Software Engineering program and is designed to introduce students to core programming concepts using Python.
I'm learning how to work with arrays, lists, objects, and classes, and exploring important technologies like HTML, CSS, HTTP, and bitwise operations. 
The course also gives me my first experience with web development and helps me build a solid foundation for the next steps in my journey
